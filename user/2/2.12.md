# 2.12. Edit task details

On the page shown here, the details and plugins for tasks can be configured. The page does not differ significantly between tasks of process templates and those of existing processes. Differences are marked where appropriate.

![On this page, fundamental settings and plugins can be configured for tasks.](../../.gitbook/assets/placeholder.png)

## Title

The title of the task is specified in this field. This can be freely selected. However, it should be taken into account that Goobi scripts, for example, use the respective task titles to automatically execute background tasks across many processes.

Therefore titles should be short, meaningful and unique. Spaces and special characters are allowed.

## Order

The position number is used to specify the position of a task in a process template or an existing process. Accordingly, an integer must be specified here.

On the one hand, the position number is used to display all tasks of a process in the correct processing sequence. On the other hand, when tasks are completed, those next tasks within a process that follow the sequence according to the current task are unlocked.

Several tasks can have the same position number. This then means for Goobi that the concerning tasks may be executed simultaneously. Parallel processing works with both automatic and manual tasks (for example, when several employees are working on a task in parallel).

If the task sequence of a process is configured with gaps (for example 1, 2, 3, 6), Goobi jumps directly to the task with the next highest number.

The order of tasks also plays an important role in Goobi Scripts. There, based on the number specified here, further administrative precautions can be taken.

## (allow parallel task)

## Priority

In this list it is possible to select a priority for the current task. It should be noted that the priorities `Standard`, `Priority`, `High priority` and `Highest priority` are only intended to visually represent the importance of tasks. They have no further technical effect on the corresponding process.

The `Correction` option also has no effect on the task, but is automatically set if the final result in a task to be completed is not to be accepted and a correction message is sent.

## Metadata

This option can be activated if it is in the sense of the task to edit metadata.

If a task is marked with the 'Metadata' property, additional icons and options are displayed at various places in the user interface to access metadata. For example, the button for calling the metadata editor is also displayed if a task has this property.

If metadata in a task is to be uploaded, downloaded, validated or used in any other way, this option must be selected.

## Validation plugin

A task can be configured to run a validation plugin upon completion. The corresponding plugin can be set in this field. Validation plugins usually start with the prefix `intranda_validation_`.

## Plugin for time delay

Time delay plugins can be included as tasks in the workflow to pause automatic processing for a certain time. If a task is to be used for time delay, this checkbox must be set and a corresponding plugin must be set.

The corresponding plugin is selected in the 'Step plugin' field. Plugins that can be used for time delay usually start with the prefix `intranda_delay_`.
