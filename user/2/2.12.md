# 2.12. Edit task details

On the page shown here, the details and plugins for tasks can be configured. The page does not differ significantly between tasks of process templates and those of existing processes. Differences are marked where appropriate.

![On this page, fundamental settings and plugins can be configured for tasks.](../../.gitbook/assets/placeholder.png)

## Title

The title of the task is specified in this field. This can be freely selected. However, it should be taken into account that Goobi scripts, for example, use the respective task titles to automatically execute background tasks across many processes.

Therefore titles should be short, meaningful and unique. Spaces and special characters are allowed.

## Order

The position number is used to specify the position of a task in a process template or an existing process. Accordingly, an integer must be specified here.

On the one hand, the position number is used to display all tasks of a process in the correct processing sequence. On the other hand, when tasks are completed, those next tasks within a process that follow the sequence according to the current task are unlocked.

Several tasks can have the same position number. This then means for Goobi that the concerning tasks may be executed simultaneously. Parallel processing works with both automatic and manual tasks (for example, when several employees are working on a task in parallel).

If the task sequence of a process is configured with gaps (for example 1, 2, 3, 6), Goobi jumps directly to the task with the next highest number.

The order of tasks also plays an important role in Goobi Scripts. There, based on the number specified here, further administrative precautions can be taken.

## Allow parallel tasks

**This setting is only available when creating a new task within a process template.**

Furthermore, this setting is only relevant when new tasks are to be inserted between already existing tasks.

If this option is **set**, the position number is set directly when the task is created. It may happen that another task already exists with the same number and both tasks can be processed in parallel later.

If this option is **not set**, then in the case of a duplication of the sequence number with that of another already existing task, the sequence numbers of the other and all subsequent tasks are shifted back by exactly one number when saving. This ensures that the new task inserted in the process does not duplicate any existing position number and that the subsequent tasks can still retain their defined numbering relative to each other (including missing and duplicated numbers).

If it turns out afterwards that this option was wrongly selected when creating the task and all subsequent tasks have a "wrong" position number, there are two possible solutions: For small adjustments, the position number can be adjusted at any time in the task overview of the process template using the buttons available for this purpose. For large adjustments, or if tasks already exist for the current process template, it is recommended to write a Goobi script so that it adjusts all "wrong" numbers and is executed on all incorrectly numbered tasks.

## Priority

In this list it is possible to select a priority for the current task. It should be noted that the priorities `Standard`, `Priority`, `High priority` and `Highest priority` are only intended to visually represent the importance of tasks. They have no further technical effect on the corresponding process.

The `Correction` option also has no effect on the task, but is automatically set if the final result in a task to be completed is not to be accepted and a correction message is sent.

## Metadata

This option can be activated if it is in the sense of the task to edit metadata.

If a task is marked with the 'Metadata' property, additional icons and options are displayed at various places in the user interface to access metadata. For example, the button for calling the metadata editor is also displayed if a task has this property.

If metadata in a task is to be uploaded, downloaded, validated or used in any other way, this option must be selected.

## Read images

This option can be activated if it is in the sense of the task to access image files with read rights. This may be the case, for example, when images are to be downloaded or displayed for quality checking.

## Write images

This option can be activated if it is in the sense of the task to access image files with write permissions. This is always necessary when images are to be uploaded or edited.

## Validate on exit

This option can be enabled to validate the metadata of the process when completing this task. This validation has nothing to do with the validation plugin (see below). The type of validation set here checks if all metadata, structure elements (DocStructs) and page counts have been applied according to the rule set.

## Export

This option can be enabled if it is in the sense of the task to export data for further processing with other systems. This can be, for example, other database formats, content management systems (CMS) or simply certain file formats. If this task is defined as an export task, an export plugin must be selected in the 'Step plugin' field. Export plugins usually start with the prefix `intranda_export_`.

## Skip this task

This option can be selected if the task should be skipped in the process. If a task has this property, it will be closed as soon as a user accepts it.

## Automatic task

Different types of tasks can be configured as automatic tasks. This allows, for example, plugins or Goobi scripts to be processed either directly or in one of the available processing queues.

In order to use processing queues, they must first be enabled in the corresponding configuration files and set up accordingly. If this option is then activated, a drop-down menu appears below the checkbox from which the desired processing queue can be selected. If the option `Don't execute in processing queue` is selected, the corresponding plugin or script is executed directly.

Specifically, the following types of tasks can be automated: Time delay tasks, HTTP tasks, export tasks and script tasks. In each case, make sure that the corresponding plugin or script is selected as described in the corresponding chapter.

## Status

In this drop-down menu, the status of the task can be set manually. Typically, in a process template, all tasks are set to `Locked` and the first one to `Open`, so that later in each process, editing can start at the first task. In the course of editing, Goobi sets all open tasks to `In queue` or `In process` and finished tasks to `Completed`. In case of an error, the task is automatically set to `Error`.

Additionally, there is an option `Deactivated` to deactivate a task completely. This will be skipped by Goobi when editing the process. The `Error` status can also be used manually to indicate that an edit has not taken place as desired and may need to be repeated.

When setting the status in a task in an already existing and edited process, care should be taken here to avoid unwanted side effects caused by automatic tasks being opened or closed manually, which are triggered by this intervention in the workflow.

## Batch step

## Step plugin

In this drop-down menu, a plugin is selected that is to be used for the task currently being processed. There are different possibilities for what the plugin selected here can be used for. Different possibilities are described in more detail in other subchapters on this page.

Plugins can be used for automatic or semi-automatic tasks. In this case, time delay plugins (`intranda_delay_*`), validation plugins (`intranda_validation_*`), export plugins (`intranda_export_*`) or other types of plugins can be selected. Plugins that bring their own user interface and are not already described in one of the other categories on this page can also be selected here.

For tasks that should not use a plugin, this field is left empty.

## Validation plugin

A task can be configured to run a validation plugin upon completion. The corresponding plugin can be set in this field. Validation plugins usually start with the prefix `intranda_validation_`.

## Plugin for time delay

Time delay plugins can be included as tasks in the process to pause automatic processing for a certain time. If a task is to be used for time delay, this checkbox must be set and a corresponding plugin must be set.

The corresponding plugin is selected in the 'Step plugin' field. Plugins that can be used for time delay usually start with the prefix `intranda_delay_`.

## Update metadata index when finishing

This option can be activated if a new metadata version is to be specified when completing this task. This will be stored in the metadata files and in the Goobi database, among others.

## Download the docket as PDF file

This option can be enabled to automatically create and offer for download a docket file as a PDF when the current task is completed. This can be handy to manually check the current technical status of the process.
