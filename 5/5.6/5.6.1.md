# 5.6.1. Filtering processes

If you want to search for specific processes, you can use Goobi’s extended search function. To do this, select the menu bar option `Workflow – Search for volume`.

![Extended dialogue box for process searches](../../.gitbook/assets/73e.png)

In order to conduct a finely tuned search, Goobi’s `Search for volume` dialogue box uses a filter syntax that makes it possible to identify the requested processes on the database.

The above diagrams show how a search is performed in Goobi using its internal search syntax based on the search details entered in the dialogue box. The search syntax generated by Goobi can be seen in the filter box Find processes above the table and can be extended to include additional parameters. It is also possible to save a search in case it is needed on future occasions. It will then appear in the drop-down list of pre-defined filters and can be executed at any time. 

Below you will find an explanation of the background filter syntax. This is useful because manually combining the search parameters described below allows you to perform more detailed searches than is the case simply using the dialogue box. The following table contains a description of some typical search filters and how they work.  


_**Examples of the detailed filter syntax for use with process searches**_

| **Filter syntax** | **Description of function** |
| :--- | :--- |
| ab | Filter to display all processes from all projects with the condition that the process name must contain `ab`. |
| -ab | Filter to display all processes with the condition that the process name must not contain `ab`. |
| ab -abc | Filter to display all processes with the conditions that the process name must contain `ab` but must not contain `abc`. |
| a?c | Filter to display all processes with the condition that the process name must contain `a`, `any character` and `c`. |
| a\*c | Filter to display all processes with the condition that the process name must contain `a`, `any number of characters` \(including none\) and `c`. |
| meta:Shelfmark:123 | Filter to display all processes with the condition that the metadata item `Shelfmark` must contain the value `123`. |
| meta:Author:Mustermann | Filter to display all processes with the condition that the metadata item `Author` must contain the value `Mustermann`. |
| "meta:Author:Max Mustermann" "meta:Author:John Doe" | Filter to display all processes for which both the authors `Max Mustermann` and `John Doe` have been recorded. |
| meta:index.Person:Mustermann | Filter to display all processes that contain the value `Mustermann` in the `Persons index`. |
| meta:\*:123 | Filter to display all processes that contain the value `123` in `any item` of metadata. |
| -meta:Shelfmark:\* | Filter to display all processes that have no `Shelfmark`. |
| batch:3 | Filter to display all processes allocated to the `batch` with the number `3`. |
| log:intranda | Filter to display all processes that contain the word `intranda` in the `Process log`. |
| project:sample\_project | Filter to display all processes from the project `sample_project`. |
| „project:sample project“ | Filter to display all processes from a project where the project name contains `blank spaces`. |
| -ab project:sample\_project | Filter to display all processes from the project `sample_project` with `ab` in the name. |
| ab -abc „project:sample project” | Filter to display all processes from the project `sample_project` with `ab` but not `abc` in the name. |
| „-project:sample project“ | Filter to display all processes that do not belong to the project `sample project` |
| step:6 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `6` has already been `completed`. |
| stepInWork:7 | Filter to display all processes from all projects for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` is `currently being processed` . |
| stepOpen:7 | Filter to display all processes for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` is `waiting to be processed` by a user. |
| stepLocked:7 | Filter to display all processes for which the workflow step with the sequential number `7` is still `locked`. |
| stepDone4: stepLocked:7 | Filter to display all processes for which at least workflow step `4` has been `completed` but step `7` has `not yet been released for processing`. |
| stepInWork:Imaging | Filter to display all processes for which a workflow step with the name `Imaging` is `currently being processed`. |
| stepDone:Export „project:sample project” | Filter to display all processes belonging to the project `sample project` for which a workflow step with the name `Export` has already been `completed`. |
| „id:17, 18, 19“ | Filter to display all processes with the internal Goobi `identifiers` `17`, `18` or `19`. |
| template:123 | Filter to display all processes for which the `physical source` contains a `property` including the value `123` . |
| template:shelfmark:123 intranda | Filter to display all processes for which the `shelfmark` property of the `physical source` contains the value `123` and the `process name` contains `intranda`. |
| workpiece:intranda | Filter to display all processes for which the property of the associated `workpiece` contains the value `intranda` . |
| workpiece:Artist:intranda | Filter to display all processes for which the workpiece property `Artist` contains the value `intranda`. |
| workpiece:Artist:intranda process:shelfmark:123 „project:sample project” stepDone:Imaging 456 | Filter to display all processes from the project `sample project` for which the process name contains `456`; at least the workflow step `Imaging` has been `completed`; the `shelfmark` of the `physical source` contains `123`, and the `workpiece property Artist` contains `intranda`. |

As you can see from the examples given above, it is possible to conduct some very complex filter-based searches by combining a wide range of parameters. Unlike the simple filters you can apply in the dialogue box, by using the correct filter syntax you can use the same parameters more than once with different values for a single search \(e.g. to simultaneously retrieve both completed workflow steps and others that are still in progress\).

All the parameters listed above can be combined with each other as required. Please note, however, that any parameters containing a blank space should be written inside double quotation marks.
